### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


# Questioning data visualisations

## Image 1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Speaking-the-world.jpg")
```

the visualisation is denying the respect of mathematics because the difference between 380 and 466 is less than 765 and 466 and the difference in the area of the bar does not accurately represent that.

## Image 2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rose-pop-density-total-area-bw.jpg")
```

what does the pie chart even represent 
data and mathematically incorrect - we don't know what the segements of the pie chart even represents - it is also lacking color. 



## Image 3

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/life-expectancy-rule-of-law.png")
```

- overlap in the data
- did not put numbers on the y axis and x axis / no title
- no meaning for the size of the circle
- don't know what the colors of the circles mean
- overlap - the colors mix 




## Image 4

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/global-income-dist.PNG")
```

- data - untidy data: merged areas
- axis numbers are not proportionate 
- numbers of the x axis compared to the area makes no sense 
- not appropriate way to show the data 

# Exercises

```{r load-data-staff, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```


## Exercise 1

What is the difference between *wide format* data and *long format* data?
long has more rows - each observation has its own row 
wide has more columns


Is the format `staff` data *wide* or *long*?
format is wide 

How many observations are there in the data set?
55 observations 

## Exercise 2

```{r pivoting}

staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c('1975','1989', '1993', '1995', '1999', '2001', '2003', '2005', '2007', '2009', '2011'), 
    names_to = "year",
    values_to = "percent"
    )

```


## Exercise 3

```{r dot-plot}
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
  geom_point()



```

## Exercise 4

```{r bad-line-plot}

ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
geom_line()

```

## Exercise 5

```{r mutate-year}

staff_long <- staff_long %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```


```{r working-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 5 here
ggplot(data = staff_long,
       mapping = aes(x = year, 
                     y = percent, 
                     colour = faculty_type)) +
geom_line()


```

## Exercise 6

```{r better-line-plot}
# Write your code for Exercise 6 here




```

## Exercise 7

_Write below your ideas for adapting the line plot_

* Idea 1
* Idea 2
* Idea 3
* ...


## Exercise 8

```{r implement-Ex7}
# Write your code for Exercise 8 here



```
